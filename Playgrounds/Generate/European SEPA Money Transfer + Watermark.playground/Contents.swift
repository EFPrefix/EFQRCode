 # European Credit Transfer code + Watermark
 
 The code below generates a EPC QR code to initiate a SEPA credit transfer. Almost any European banking
 app can be used to scan this code and execute a money transfer.
 
 All settings are according to the [official spec](https://www.europeanpaymentscouncil.eu/sites/default/files/kb/file/2018-05/EPC069-12%20v2.1%20Quick%20Response%20Code%20-%20Guidelines%20to%20Enable%20the%20Data%20Capture%20for%20the%20Initiation%20of%20a%20SCT.pdf). See also [Wikipedia EPC QR Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPC_QR_code).
 
 Thie examples below create money transfer codes of €1 to the Belgian Red Cross.

Note: In production code, you should abstract this data to a struct with some basic checks. For example - limit the size of the Remittance fields in order to not generate large QR codes (According to spec: "Maximum QR code version 13, equivalent to module size 69 or 331 byte payload")
